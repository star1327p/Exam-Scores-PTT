The author grew up in Taiwan, so we are curious about the relationship between the high school entrance exam score percentiles and the college entrance scores in Taiwan.^[<https://bit.ly/2JSPXKc>] Due to the meritocracy-based high school placement \cite{chu2013high, yang2021meritocracy}, generally a larger percentage of students from top high schools get admitted to prestigious universities \cite{hung2009access, yu2023understanding}. However, the high school entrance exam is much easier than the college entrance exam,^[<https://www.parenting.com.tw/article/5094660>] so some students studied little in middle school and were able to get into a good high school \cite{albanese2021bricolage}. Then some of them kept studying little and ended up with a bad score on the college entrance exam \cite{tsai2016underachievement}. On the other hand, we have also seen some students from non-top-tier high schools studied very hard, and eventually earned a stellar score in the college exam.^[<https://www.pttweb.cc/bbs/NTU_CK_CM/M.1235046292.A.41C>] Therefore, we decided to gather data and create our own analysis.  

The Taiwan government publishes aggregated data on high school entrance exam scores^[<https://www.ceec.edu.tw/>] and college entrance exam scores^[<https://cap.rcpet.edu.tw/>] separately, but does not link between the two sets of data by anonymized individuals. (The closest linkage is the college admission numbers for selected high schools.^[<https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/juniorhigh/M.1407508506.A.1C9.html>]) Therefore, we obtained self-reported data from an existing post^[<https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/SENIORHIGH/M.1432729401.A.995.html>] in 2015 on PTT, the largest terminal-based bulletin board in Taiwan \cite{liang2017brief}. Each of the 197 rows of the data contains an anonymous ID, high school entrance exam score (in the form of percentile rank), and college entrance exam score. Since PTT has been advertised to a wide range of college campuses, many college students as of 2015 were using PTT.^[PTT Screenshot obtained on June 24, 2022: <https://imgur.com/Y0pHLiR>] Hence the PTT data are assumed to be diverse, i.e., from people with different levels of academic achievements \cite{chen2020exploration}.    

The goal of writing this manuscript is to demonstrate how to perform data analysis in `R` using real-life data with a reproducible workflow. We also make this project open-source on GitHub,^[<https://github.com/star1327p/Exam-Scores-PTT>] so that anyone interested can leverage the data analysis framework as well as the statistical methodology. The target audience is people with a basic understanding of statistics, equivalent to taking or having completed Statistics 101. We start from collecting the data, preprocessing the data, exploratory analysis, and finally define a problem statement that can be answered by the data. Then we build the statistical model, validate the results, and provide our interpretations. In this way, readers can follow the step-by-step instructions in this small-scale data science project. Readers will also learn how to handle issues and continue the analysis in a real application problem.     

The rest of this manuscript is organized as follows. Chapter \ref{background} gives an overview of the high school and college entrance exams in Taiwan, and Chapter \ref{data} provides the description of our dataset. In Chapter \ref{eda}, we start the technical content with exploratory data analysis, in order to identify and visualize the distribution of exam scores. Then in Chapter \ref{linear-reg} we try the linear regression and explain whether this model is appropriate or not. Chapter \ref{explore-top} further examines the top scorers, because they typically came from prestigious high schools and/or colleges. In Chapter \ref{logit-reg}, we modify the problem statement to binary outcomes and implement the logistic regression. Then we perform in-sample validation in Chapter \ref{validation} and out-of-sample validation in Chapter \ref{out-of-sample}. After the model validation is complete, we use some metrics to evaluate the model performance in Chapter \ref{roc-auc}. Towards the end, we provide a recap of the project in Chapter \ref{recap} and recommend more resources for learning in Chapter \ref{resources}. Finally, we state some personal remarks in Chapter \ref{personal-remarks}.
