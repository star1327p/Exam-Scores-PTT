The author has been building this project on and off since 2019. With limited time outside her full-time job and various hobbies, she persevered and completed this whole document little by little. Depending on her availability, some days she wrote multiple paragraphs in a single commit, while other days she wrote as few as 2-3 sentences. Writing a large document may seem challenging in the beginning, but the author demonstrated that it is possible to finish one through accumulation of efforts. There is no secret ingredient -- just keep writing. Here is a quote from Jodi Picoult, an American bestselling author:^[<https://www.jodipicoult.com/>] "You can always edit a bad page. You can't edit a blank page."^[<https://www.writingforward.com/better-writing/you-cant-edit-a-blank-page>] You do not have to write every day, but you have to be consistent in the process. It is also acceptable to pause for a few weeks (or even months), and come back to the project again.    

In addition to the motivations stated in the Introduction (Chapter \ref{intro}) and the Personal Scores and Remarks (Chapter \ref{personal-remarks}), the author was also inspired by the book *Build a Career in Data Science* \cite{robinson2020build}. She saw some interesting meta-analysis about the writing process of the book,^[<https://jnolis.com/blog/data_science_on_book/>] such as how many words were written by which person and at what time of the day. She realized that writing a book and/or a long manuscript takes tremendous work,^[<https://hookedondata.org/posts/2021-04-06_publishing-a-technical-book-part-3/>] but the knowledge-sharing advantages are well worth the time and energy spent.^[<https://hookedondata.org/posts/2021-04-06_publishing-a-technical-book-part-1/>] Publishing something in the open world not only builds your portfolio, but also increases your visibility and exposure. You are also likely to receive a few positive responses from readers, including potential collaboration invitations.   

This may sound like a cliche, but the author definitely learned a lot throughout the project -- not just the statistical content. Hard skills include and are not limited to Git, $\mathsf{R}$, and writing reproducible code. One of the author's favorite part is generating "green squares" (GitHub commits) as tangible evidence of progress.^[<https://www.palomamedina.com/biceps>] It feels like planting virtual trees on her own GitHub garden. The author also gained soft skills from the process, such as effective written communication and time management. Most importantly, she learned how to break down a large project into smaller tasks. In data science job interviews, she encountered some questions relevant to concepts in this project, such as the conditional probability and model metrics. Side benefits of writing this document are to refresh your knowledge and deepen your understanding of data science. We never know when the skills will come in handy in the future.    
 
This project is the longest manuscript the author has independently completed after her PhD dissertation \cite{chai2017phdthesis}. Other long-form publications she has written as a single author include her review article on text preprocessing \cite{chai2023comparison} and her Master's thesis \cite{chai2013masters}. The author has collaborated with others on a wide range of topics throughout the years, including Bayesian statistics \cite{lu2022robust, clyde2018bayesian101}, federal survey analysis \cite{avery2014profile}, and other statistical applications \cite{henry2019modeling, beckman2015investigating}. The author is also a regular contributor to the Royal Statistical Society (RSS)^[<https://rss.org.uk/>] discussion papers, in which she writes constructive feedback up to 400 words per session. Examples are \cite{chai-2024-rss-census}, \cite{chai-2023-rss-climate}, and \cite{chai-2021-rss-betting}.
