\section*{\textcolor{red}{Unfinished Below}}

1. Add captions for all figures, starting from Section \ref{bivariate}.  

2. Change the size of each figure when necessary. Some figures are too large and take up too much space.

I may not need to add more references until I fix the two issues above. Then I can ask some friends (preferably current high school teachers) to verify the correctness of the high school and college entrance rules in Taiwan.

# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

In this project, we investigate the relationship between high school and college entrance exam scores in Taiwan using self-reported data online. The goal is to demonstrate reproducible statistical analysis in $\mathsf{R}$ Markdown and LaTeX to PDF. We start by exploring the data to formulate the problem statement and identify the appropriate model, which can be an iterative process. We eventually decided on a binary outcome of the college entrance exams, and hence implemented a logistic regression model. We also validate the model with out-of-sample prediction methods, including cross validation as well as separate training and testing sets. Finally, we use some metrics to evaluate the model performance. The end-to-end data analysis can be compiled with a single button in RStudio, without copying-and-pasting output from one program to another.

The author would like to thank Dr. Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and Dr. David Banks at Duke University; they both motivated the author to teach statistics and create reproducible work in $\mathsf{R}$. The author is also grateful to her former Microsoft colleagues Smit Patel and Dylan Stout for troubleshooting GitHub issues.  

The author would also like to acknowledge Dr. Cliburn Chan and Dr. Janice McCarthy for introducing her to GitHub in the statistical computation course at Duke University.^[<https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2015/>] This provided her the foundations to use GitHub as a modern version control system in the first place.  

Finally, the author gives a special mention to her significant other, Hugh Hendrickson, for all his support in the author's professional career development.
