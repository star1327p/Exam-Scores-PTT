## Statistical Analysis of High School and College Entrance Exam Scores in Taiwan with Online Data: A Fully Reproducible Approach with R Markdown  

Christine P. Chai

#### Executive Summary

In this project, we investigate the relationship between high school and college entrance exam scores in Taiwan using self-reported data online. The goal is to demonstrate reproducible statistical analysis in R Markdown and LaTeX to PDF. We start by exploring the data to formulate the problem statement and identify the appropriate model, which can be an iterative process. We eventually decided on a binary outcome of the college entrance exams, and hence implemented a logistic regression model. We also validate the model with out-of-sample prediction methods, including cross validation as well as separate training and testing sets. Finally, we use some metrics to evaluate the model performance. The end-to-end data analysis can be compiled with a single button in RStudio, without copying-and-pasting output from one program to another.

#### Data Source

We obtained the high school and college entrance score data sample from [PTT](https://term.ptt.cc/), the largest terminal-based bulletin board in Taiwan.

#### To-Do:

1. Need to add more references, instead of just URLs. Especially on Taiwan's education system, which I have very few items listed in the References. Most of my references are about statistics and/or data science itself.

- Tentative goal: Add enough references for the PDF to have at least 90 pages.
- The Introduction section needs to be stronger and more convincing.
- Definitely need more references for the Background section.

2. Also check the references in detail. 

3. Ask some friends (preferably current high school teachers) to verify the correctness of the high school and college entrance rules in Taiwan.  

4. Ask other friends for feedback on my report.

5. Revise the report according to the feedback I receive.

6. Recheck everything one more time.

7. Obtain approval to list my new affiliation with the disclaimer.

8. Finally, publish this article to ResearchGate.
