We built the logistic regression model in Chapter \ref{logit-reg}, and now it is time for model validation, i.e., evaluate the model performance. We will focus on machine learning concepts in this chapter, and the readers simply need to know that **the model does binary classification**. For more about machine learning, we recommend the book *Introduction to Machine Learning* \cite{alpaydin2020introduction}. It explains a wide range of machine learning algorithms and applications, including the recent advances in deep learning and neural networks.  

We start with in-sample prediction to obtain the binary classification results, then we explain how to interpret the 2x2 confusion matrix output. There are two actual outcomes for **College_Score** -- at least 65 or not. There are also two predicted outcomes for **College_Score**, and we compare the predicted outcomes with the actual ones. Next, we would like to examine the model performance for different **HighSchool_PR** scores, in order to identify whether the model does better in higher or lower **HighSchool_PR**, or performs about the same. In Chapter \ref{out-of-sample}, we will perform out-of-sample prediction on the model; that is, train the model on some data and test it on different data.
