% ``In order to standardize students' performance, PRs were also computed for each student based on the percentile ranking of their total scores relative to all exam takers in Taiwan. PR is a key factor in the assignment of students to high schools (each high school in Taiwan sets specific entry criteria expressed in term of PR, only accepting students whose PR meet or exceed this). In general, a single PR increase is sufficient to allow entry to a school 1 to 2 place higher in the national rankings.''

% ``The first was the 2001 replacement of the Joint High School Entrance Examination with the Basic Competence Test (BCtest) for junior high school students. The BCtest was a required test for all junior high graduates and evaluated competence in five subjects: Mandarin, Mathematics, English, Science, and social studies. All BCtest items were multiple choice except for the Writing Assessment, which was included in 2007. Students could take the BCtest twice in 1 year and use their better score for admission into a senior secondary school. However, as part of the implementation of Taiwan’s 12-year basic education policy, the BCtest was replaced with the CAP in 2014. Unlike the BCtest, the CAP was only administered once a year, and a section evaluating English listening comprehension was added. Rather than a scaled score, the test results were reported in three levels—proficient, basic, and improvement needed.''
