The goal of building this model is to optimize the performance for future input, i.e., incoming students who just obtained their **HighSchool_PR** scores. We need to use the model to predict new data, and this validation method is called out-of-sample prediction. That is, the model must be able to predict data outside the training sample.   

In-sample prediction (Chapter \ref{validation}) is insufficient because we need to test on unseen data to **avoid overfitting**.^[<https://elitedatascience.com/overfitting-in-machine-learning>] But why is overfitting bad? Because the model would do well on the existing data but perform poorly on the new data, which is undesirable. This is similar to students who memorize the answers to score 100% on quizzes without understanding the actual content. Hence they may not do well on the final exam, because they have not seen the questions before. In order to measure the students' grasp of the knowledge, the instructor usually gives exam questions similar to the practice questions, but not exactly the same.    

Some readers may be wondering how to get "new" data to perform out-of-sample prediction, and the good news is that we already have them. New data means **previously unseen** data by the model. In other words, any data not involved in training the model can be regarded as "new data" \cite{aggarwal2015data}. Although training the model requires data, we do not have to feed in all 188 records at once. We can use a part of the records to train the model, and leverage the remaining data to test the model for performance evaluation. In this way, the latter part of the data are considered "new" because they are not seen by the model beforehand. The data involved in the training phase is called the training dataset, and the data used for testing is called the testing dataset.  

In this chapter, we demonstrate two methods to implement out-of-sample prediction. The first method is using **separate training and testing datasets** to validate the model, where the two datasets are mutually exclusive. We train the model on the training set, and test the model on the testing set. The second method is **cross validation**, which involves partitioning the data into a number of subsets, then we reserve one subset for testing and train the model on all the remaining subsets. Each subset takes turns to be used for testing, and finally we combine the results to estimate the overall prediction performance.
